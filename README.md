# Machine Learning Applications: Insights from Diverse Datasets

## Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and derive insights from three diverse datasets:
1. **Hotel Booking Dataset**: Predicting hotel booking cancellations.
2. **Fake News Dataset**: Detecting and classifying fake news.
3. **Energy Consumption Dataset**: Forecasting high-energy consumption scenarios.

The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluating multiple machine learning models to assess their effectiveness in addressing real-world challenges across hospitality, media, and energy sectors.

## Key Highlights
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - K-Fold Validation
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Achievements**:
  - Hotel bookings: Random Forest achieved 99.96% accuracy.
  - Fake news detection: K-Fold Validation reached 96% accuracy.
  - Energy consumption: Decision Tree provided 97% accuracy.

## Methodology
The project follows the **CRISP-DM** framework:
1. **Business Understanding**: Define goals for predictive modeling and decision-making.
2. **Data Understanding**: Analyze datasets to identify patterns and challenges.
3. **Data Preparation**: Handle missing values, balance datasets, and encode features.
4. **Modeling**: Train and evaluate machine learning models tailored to each dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance benchmarking.
6. **Deployment**: Provide actionable insights for practical implementation.

## Findings
- The performance of machine learning models depends on the dataset characteristics and problem type.
- Effective preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, and balancing datasets) is crucial.
- Advanced algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Trees excel in non-linear scenarios.

## Limitations
